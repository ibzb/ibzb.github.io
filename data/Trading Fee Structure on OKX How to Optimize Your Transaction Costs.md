# Trading Fee Structure on OKX: How to Optimize Your Transaction Costs  

## Understanding OKX Fee Tiers  

OKX employs a tiered fee system that categorizes users into **Standard** and **Professional** levels based on trading activity or asset holdings. Key factors include:  

- **Standard Users**: Fee levels depend on OKB token holdings.  
- **Professional Users**: Fee levels are determined by trading volume across spot, futures, and options markets.  

### How Fee Tiers Work  
Users qualify for specific fee tiers by meeting criteria in **any one** of the following categories:  
- 30-day spot trading volume  
- 30-day futures contract volume  
- 30-day options trading volume
