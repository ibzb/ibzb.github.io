# How to Deposit on OKX in 2025: A Step-by-Step Guide  

In today’s rapidly evolving digital landscape, cryptocurrency trading and investment have become mainstream financial activities. As a leading digital asset exchange, OKX (formerly OKEx) attracts users worldwide with its diverse trading options, user-friendly interface, and robust security protocols. However, depositing funds (often called "recharging" or "topping up") can seem daunting for newcomers. This guide will walk you through the 2025 process of depositing cryptocurrency on OKX, ensuring a seamless experience while prioritizing security and efficiency.  

## Understanding the Basics of Crypto Deposits  

Before diving into the step-by-step process, it’s essential to grasp key concepts:  

- **Deposit Address**: A unique blockchain identifier generated by OKX for receiving specific cryptocurrencies.  
- **Network Compatibility**: Cryptocurrencies like USDT or ETH operate on multiple blockchains (e.g., ERC-20, TRC-20). Using the wrong network risks permanent fund loss.  
- **Transaction Fees**: Each deposit incurs a blockchain network fee, which varies based on network congestion.
