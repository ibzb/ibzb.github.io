## Why Avoid Dual Currency Investments?  

While dual currency products offer **potentially higher returns**, they expose investors to **significant market risks**. These instruments require predicting price movements of two cryptocurrencies simultaneously, a strategy that can lead to **principal loss** if market conditions turn unfavorable.  

The Shark Fin productâ€™s **capital protection feature** eliminates this risk, ensuring your initial investment remains intact regardless of underlying asset performance.

## Maximizing Returns: Proven Strategies

### 2. Optimize Term Selection  
Short-term plans (7â€“30 days) offer liquidity for dynamic market conditions, while long-term commitments (90+ days) typically yield higher annualized returns.  

### 3. Combine with Low-Risk Staking  
Pair Shark Fin investments with OKXâ€™s **USDT staking options** to further boost passive income while maintaining portfolio stability.
