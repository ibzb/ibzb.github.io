## Step-by-Step Guide to Sending Bitcoin

### Step 1: Open Cash App and Navigate to the Bitcoin Section  
Launch the Cash App and tap the **Banking** tab at the bottom of the screen. Scroll to the **Bitcoin** section and select it. This will display your current BTC balance and transaction history.

### Step 2: Initiate the Transfer  
Tap the **Send** button within the Bitcoin interface. You‚Äôll be prompted to enter the recipient‚Äôs wallet address.  

üîç **Pro Tip**: Double-check the address for typos. Bitcoin transactions are irreversible, and sending funds to an incorrect address may result in permanent loss.

### Step 3: Enter the Recipient‚Äôs Wallet Address  
Manually input the wallet address or scan a QR code if the recipient provides one. Cash App supports QR code scanning for convenience.  

üîí **Security Note**: Always verify the address with the recipient via a trusted communication channel (e.g., phone call or encrypted messaging).

### Step 4: Specify the Amount to Send  
Choose whether to enter the amount in **Bitcoin** or your local currency (e.g., USD). The app will automatically convert the value based on the current exchange rate. Adjust the amount using the slider or input field.

üìä **Example Conversion**:  
| Local Currency | Bitcoin Equivalent |  
|----------------|--------------------|  
| $500           | 0.025 BTC          |  
| $1,000         | 0.05 BTC           |  

### Step 5: Review Transaction Details  
Confirm the recipient‚Äôs address, amount, and transaction fee. Fees vary depending on network congestion and are displayed before finalization.

### Step 6: Complete Verification (If Required)  
Cash App may prompt additional verification steps, such as SMS codes or biometric authentication, to ensure security. Follow the on-screen instructions to proceed.

### Step 7: Confirm and Finalize the Transaction  
Tap **Confirm** to broadcast the transaction to the Bitcoin network. A confirmation screen will display a transaction ID (TXID) for reference.

### Step 8: Monitor Transaction Status  
The recipient‚Äôs wallet typically receives the funds within minutes, though confirmation times can vary. Use a blockchain explorer to track the transaction using the TXID.
