## 📈 Crypto Trading: Profits from Market Volatility

Trading is one of the most dynamic ways to earn from crypto. Due to the market’s high volatility, traders can profit from both rising and falling prices. Here’s how it works:

- **Short-Term Strategies**: Scalping (seconds to minutes), day trading (intraday), and swing trading (days to weeks).  
- **Income Potential**: 3%–30% monthly returns, depending on skill level and capital.  
- **Risks**: High volatility can lead to losses, especially for inexperienced traders.  

### Key Factors for Trading Success
- **Market Analysis**: Use technical indicators (RSI, MACD) and candlestick charts.  
- **Risk Management**: Never risk more than 1–2% of your capital on a single trade.  
- **Emotional Discipline**: Avoid panic selling or FOMO-driven decisions.
