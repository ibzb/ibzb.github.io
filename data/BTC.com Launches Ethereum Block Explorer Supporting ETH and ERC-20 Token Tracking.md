# BTC.com Launches Ethereum Block Explorer Supporting ETH and ERC-20 Token Tracking

## Introduction to Blockchain Data Services

The blockchain ecosystem continues evolving as BTC.com expands its professional data services with the launch of an Ethereum block explorer. While widely recognized for operating one of the largest Bitcoin mining pools, BTC.com now offers comprehensive tracking capabilities for Ethereum (ETH) and ERC-20 tokens through its newly developed platform. This strategic move positions BTC.com as a key provider of blockchain data services across three major cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and Ethereum (ETH).

## Understanding Blockchain and Block Explorers

Before diving into BTC.com's Ethereum explorer features, let's establish fundamental concepts. Blockchain technology represents a decentralized, trustless system where network participants collectively maintain a secure database. This distributed ledger system functions as a community-based accounting mechanism where every transaction becomes part of an immutable public record.

Block explorers serve as essential tools for accessing this wealth of blockchain data. These interfaces enable users to verify transactions, check wallet balances, and monitor network activity. Whether confirming cryptocurrency transfers or analyzing new block confirmations, block explorers bridge the gap between complex blockchain protocols and user-friendly information retrieval.

## BTC.com Ethereum Block Explorer Overview

BTC.com's Ethereum explorer introduces several innovative features designed to meet both casual user needs and professional requirements. Currently accessible via desktop at [eth.btc.com](https://eth.btc.com) (note: this link will be replaced during content polishing), the platform offers multilingual support starting with English and Chinese interfaces.

### Key Functionalities

## Transaction and ERC-20 Token Tracking

The explorer's search functionality enables users to investigate transactions through multiple entry points:
- Wallet addresses
- Transaction hashes
- Block numbers
- Token identifiers

This comprehensive tracking system proves particularly valuable for ERC-20 tokens, which represent the dominant standard for Ethereum-based digital assets. According to BTC.com's explorer data, the Ethereum network currently hosts over 113,404 ERC-20 smart contracts, with 538 actively traded tokens among them.

### ERC-20 Token Query Process

1. Navigate to the "Tokens" section on the explorer homepage
2. Access the complete list of ERC-20 tokens
3. Search using either:
   - Full token name
   - Symbol abbreviation
4. View detailed token metrics including:
   - Total supply
   - Holder distribution
   - Contract address

This functionality addresses critical user needs for developers, traders, and wallet service providers seeking reliable token information.

## Miner Pool Statistics and Network Analysis

BTC.com leverages its extensive mining industry expertise to provide unique insights into Ethereum's mining ecosystem. The explorer displays real-time miner pool rankings based on 24-hour block production data, highlighting the top five contributing pools. This feature proves invaluable for miners assessing network distribution and potential reward opportunities.

### Network Status Monitoring

The platform's network analysis tools offer crucial operational insights:
- **Gas Fee Estimation**: Dynamic displays of average and minimum gas prices
- **Transaction Speed Prediction**: Estimated block confirmation times for different gas price settings (hover functionality reveals detailed calculations)
- **Network Congestion Metrics**: Real-time visualization of transaction backlog and processing capacity

These tools empower users to optimize transaction parameters, reducing the risk of failed transfers due to insufficient gas allocation.
