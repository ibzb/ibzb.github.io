## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

### Q1: What are USDT-margined futures?
USDT-margined futures are contracts where positions are collateralized in **Tether (USDT)**, a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. This reduces exposure to crypto volatility in the margin asset.

### Q2: Can I withdraw HMSTR tokens from futures trading?
No. Pre-market futures contracts settle in **USDT**, and traders do not receive the underlying HMSTR tokens.

### Q3: What happens if the HMSTR TGE is canceled?
OKX reserves the right to adjust, extend, or terminate the futures contract based on market conditions or project developments.

### Q4: How does leverage affect liquidation risk?
Higher leverage increases liquidation risk. For example, a 2x leveraged position could be liquidated with a ~50% adverse price move.

### Q5: When will HMSTR futures expire?
The delivery time for HMSTR futures will be announced separately by OKX, typically aligned with the token's official listing schedule.
