## What Is Bitcoin?

As the original cryptocurrency, **Bitcoin (BTC)** established the foundation for decentralized finance. Created by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin operates on a **proof-of-work (PoW)** consensus mechanism, ensuring security through computational effort.

### Key Features of Bitcoin
- **Decentralization**: No central authority governs Bitcoin, enabling peer-to-peer transactions.
- **Fixed Supply**: With a 21 million coin cap, Bitcoin's scarcity mirrors precious metals like gold.
- **Store of Value**: Often dubbed "digital gold," Bitcoin serves as a hedge against inflation.
- **Security**: Its PoW mechanism remains one of the most secure blockchain protocols.

Bitcoinâ€™s primary role is as a **medium of exchange** and **store of value**, making it ideal for long-term investors seeking stability in the volatile crypto market.

## What Are Altcoins?

**Altcoins** (short for "alternative coins") encompass all cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin. These include **Ethereum (ETH)**, **Ripple (XRP)**, **Litecoin (LTC)**, and **Cardano (ADA)**, among thousands of others. Each altcoin addresses unique challenges or expands blockchain capabilities beyond Bitcoinâ€™s original design.

### Popular Altcoins and Their Use Cases
| Altcoin       | Primary Function                          | Unique Feature                          |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Ethereum      | Smart contracts and decentralized apps    | Programmable blockchain                  |
| Ripple (XRP)  | Cross-border payments                     | Partnered with major financial institutions |
| Litecoin      | Faster transactions                       | Segregated Witness (SegWit) implementation |
| Cardano       | Sustainable blockchain platform           | Research-driven development approach     |

Altcoins often leverage **proof-of-stake (PoS)** or hybrid consensus models, enabling faster transactions and lower energy consumption compared to Bitcoinâ€™s PoW system.
