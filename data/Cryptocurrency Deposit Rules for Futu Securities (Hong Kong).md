2. **Network Compatibility Requirement**:  
   Always use the **exact blockchain network specified** by Futu. Mismatched networks (e.g., sending Ethereum on a Bitcoin network) will result in **permanent loss of funds**.  

### Source Address Requirements  
1. **Personal Wallet Mandate**:  
   Deposits must originate from **self-managed wallets** (e.g., MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Ledger) where you control private keys.  

2. **Exchange Wallet Restriction**:  
   Transfers from **exchange-hosted wallets** (e.g., Binance Exchange, Coinbase) will fail. Only **Web3 wallet addresses** associated with exchanges are acceptable.  

3. **Cross-Platform Verification Policy**:  
   Addresses previously used on other platforms (e.g., Hashkey Exchange, Victory Securities) require re-verification through Futu's process.  

## Wallet Type Clarification  

| Wallet Category | Characteristics | Examples |  
|------------------|------------------|----------|  
| **Personal Wallet** | User-controlled private keys | MetaMask, Ledger, Trezor |  
| **Exchange Wallet** | Platform-managed keys | Binance Exchange, Coinbase |  

> **Critical Note**: OKX Web3 Wallet functions as a personal wallet, while OKX Exchange operates as a custodial service. Always verify wallet type before initiating transfers.

   - BTC: 1 confirmation  
   - ETH: 30 confirmations

## Minimum Deposit Requirements  

| Cryptocurrency | Minimum Deposit Threshold |  
|----------------|---------------------------|  
| Bitcoin (BTC)  | 0.001 BTC                 |  
| Ethereum (ETH) | 0.01 ETH                  |  
| USDT (ERC-20)  | 10 USDT                   |  

Deposits below these thresholds will be **irretrievably rejected**. Always verify amounts before confirming blockchain transactions.  

## Verification Procedures  

### Address Ownership Confirmation  
1. **Unverified Address Protocol**:  
   Funds from unverified wallets enter a **pending state** until you complete Futu's verification process.  

2. **Multi-Platform Usage Impact**:  
   Addresses registered on multiple platforms require **enhanced due diligence** to prevent unauthorized access.  

## Frequently Asked Questions  

**Q: Why do exchange wallet transfers fail?**  
A: Exchange wallets operate under custodial models that prevent direct transfers to brokerage accounts. Use personal wallets for successful deposits.  

**Q: How can I verify my personal wallet address?**  
A: Initiate a small test transaction (above minimum thresholds) and complete Futu's verification workflow within the platform.  

**Q: What happens during network congestion?**  
A: High blockchain traffic may delay confirmations. Monitor transaction status through block explorers or contact support for assistance.  

**Q: Can I recover funds sent through wrong networks?**  
A: Network mismatched deposits are **non-recoverable**. Always double-check network settings before executing transfers.  

## Risk Mitigation Strategies  

1. **Address Reuse Prevention**:  
   Generate new deposit addresses for each transaction to enhance security and tracking.  

2. **Transaction Monitoring**:  
   Utilize blockchain explorers to verify confirmations and transaction status independently.
