## Understanding HIVEâ€™s Market Fundamentals  

### Why Is HIVEâ€™s Market Cap Important?  
Market capitalization reflects investor confidence and liquidity. HIVEâ€™s **$102.63M market cap** places it among mid-tier cryptocurrencies, signaling moderate institutional and retail interest. A higher market cap often correlates with reduced volatility, making HIVE a potentially safer bet compared to smaller-cap altcoins.  

### Supply Constraints and Their Impact  
With a **max supply of 500.74M HIVE**, the tokenâ€™s scarcity could drive value appreciation as demand increases. The circulating supply (480.95M) already accounts for **96.05% of FDV**, leaving limited room for future inflation. This scarcity contrasts with inflationary tokens like Dogecoin, which have unlimited supply.
